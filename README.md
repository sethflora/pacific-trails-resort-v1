# pacific-trails-resort-v1
This repository contains the source code for Pacific Trails Resort, a website built as a class project. This version represents the HTML structure phase, focusing on writing clean, semantic markup without external styling.

📝 Project Overview
The goal of this assignment was to build the content architecture for a luxury "glamping" (glamorous camping) business. It demonstrates how to organize information logically for the web.

💻 Technologies Used
HTML5: The core technology used for all page content.

Semantic Tags: Utilized <nav>, <main>, <footer>, and <header> (implied) to define page regions.

🚀 Key Features
Multi-Page Navigation: Functional links connecting the Home (index.html) and Yurts (yurts.html) pages.

Content Organization:

Definition Lists (<dl>): Used on the Yurts page to format FAQ items clearly.

Unordered Lists (<ul>): Used on the Home page to list resort amenities.

File Management: Includes a templates folder to manage reusable code structures.

🧠 What I Learned
How to create a multi-page website using relative file paths.

The difference between structural tags (like <h1>) and semantic containers (like <main>).

How to format specific data types, such as addresses and copyright information.
